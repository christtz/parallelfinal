<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We implemented three variations of linked lists: lock-free, fine-grained, coarse-grained. We also checked for correctness of these three implementations against a sequential linked list without locks. We found, after various tests, that our lock-free implementation had better performance than our fine-grained or coarse-grained linked lists.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Lock-free data structures allow multiple threads to concurrently access shared data without using synchronization primitives like mutexes. This is especially impressive because correct lock-free code prevents deadlock from occurring. Lock-free data structures also fix problems that might otherwise occur with locks such as page faults, or preemption while a thread is in a critical section (creating deadlock.) However, it is very difficult to write correct lock-free code. Our lock-free linked list is based on the non-blocking implementation described in Harris’ paper and supports inserting, removing, and finding a node. The correctness of Harris’ lock-free algorithm is ensured by linearizability, meaning that operations appear to occur atomically. In order words, the invocation of each operation is followed immediately by its response (Harris).</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach</h3>

<p>Our linked list is implemented such that there is a head node to identify entry into the list and a tail node to identify the end of the list. </p>
<p>
(i) coarse-grain <br>
Our coarse-grain linked list was implemented with a mutex that was obtained before beginning an operation and released after.
</p>
<p>
(ii) fine-grain <br>
Our fine-grain linked list was implemented with hand-over-hand locking, where each list node included its own spinlock. 
</p>
<p>
(iii) lock-free <br>
We followed Harris’ paper to implement a non-blocking linked-list, which guarantees system-wide progress. This means that even if some threads stop completely, the other threads will continue and maintain progress of the task. 
</p>

<img src="1.png" alt="Insertion" style="width:550px;height:228px;">

<p>Insertion is pretty trivial. We simply find the appropriate spot for the inserted node (using a search function that finds the left and right nodes), and perform a compare and swap on the next field of the left node. This guarantees that no other thread has intercepted and changed the successor of left node. We use gcc’s __sync_bool_compare_and_swap to atomically check that values are what we’d expect them to be. </p>

<img src="2.png" alt="Deletion with 1 CAS" style="width:550px;height:228px;">

<p>Deletion is more complicated, however, so we can’t use the same logic we would use in the sequential implementation of a linked list. Consider an example where we try to delete Node 1. Naively, we would just swing the head’s next pointer to Node 3 using compare and swap. But if we concurrently insert Node 2, then our single compare and swap won’t detect that a node has been inserted between Node 1 and Node 3. Thus, we would lose Node 2 when we delete Node 1.</p>
<p>Instead, as Harris proposes, we use two compare and swaps—the first logically deletes the node and the second physically deletes the node. We know a node is logically deleted if it is marked, meaning that its next field is marked. Since pointers in C++ are four-byte aligned, the last two bits of an address are unused. This means that we are free to change the last bit to a 1 to signal that it is “marked” and leave it as a 0 to signal that it is “unmarked.” Even if an address has a 1, we can still access it in its unmarked state and traverse through the linked list normally. </p>
<img src="3.png" alt="Deletion with 2 CAS" style="width:550px;height:228px;">
<p>Now, if Node 2 is being inserted while Node 1 is in the process of being deleted, Node 2 will see that Node 1 is logically deleted and physically delete Node 1 before inserting itself. Deletion was more troublesome to implement than insertion and we had a segfault in our code, which turned out to be because of a bad memory access. Marked fields give us addresses that don’t make sense, so it’s important to be careful with getting the correct unmarked form. </p>
<p>Harris’ paper has a proof of correctness so we just assumed the algorithm we used is correct. Harris’ algorithm, however, doesn’t solve the “ABA problem.” </p>
<p>We examined David Stolp’s “Common Pitfalls in Writing Lock-Free Algorithms,” which showed that a lock-free implementation of a stack with sleeps both increased throughput and decreased processor utilization. We wanted to try including sleeps in our lock-free linked list, but we didn’t have time. </p>
<p>
(iii) test suite <br>
We wrote a python script that renders various trace files that test different use cases with defined behavior. For example, we test our linked lists on a large number of consecutive insertions, random insertions, alternating between a large block of insertions followed by a large block of deletions, and alternating between inserting at the beginning and end of the list. Each trace file was run on our three linked lists, as well as a basic sequential linked list. Performance time is measured using CycleTimer.h, where the total time is the sum of the time it takes to complete each operation. </p>

<p>To test for correctness of our implementations, we compared the results obtained from various trace files on our fine-grain, coarse-grain, and lock-free lists using multiple threads against the results obtained from our sequential list. The behavior of multiple threads is undefined, which is to say that inserting Node x before removing Node x would give different results than vice versa. To account for this, we created trace files where each group of n operations (where n is the number of threads) would never include inserting and removing the same node if a node of the same value didn’t already exist in the list. We used barriers to do this. Our requirement for correctness was just that a resulting linked list has the same nodes in the same order as the sequential linked list.</p>

<p>To test for performance, we tried to come up with as many types of test cases as possible. </p>
